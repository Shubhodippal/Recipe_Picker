Whenever you are in a hurry then you can just add salt, few vegetables like grated carrots and spinach make a nutritious paniyaram and serve it along with idli podi or chutney.,South Indian Recipes,South Indian Breakfast,Vegetarian,30,To begin making Paniyaram With Idli/Dosa Batter Recipe, prep all the ingredients and keep them ready.Have the dosa batter ready - it's the classic dosa batter from idli rice and urad dal, soaked ground and fermented.Â\\xa0My next step is to prep all 3 variants and add to the batter and make paniyarams in a paniyaram pan.Â\\xa0First to cook the carrots, heat oil in over medium heat in a pan; add the carrots and saute until the carrots turn soft. Turn off the heat and allow the carrots to cool. Don't add any salt as yet, as the dosa batter has a little salt.Next cook the spinach; heat oil over medium heat in a pan; add the spinach and saute until the spinach wilts completely and once done, turn off the heat and keep aside to cool.Once cooled, add the carrots to the Mixer Grinder along with 1 cup of the dosa batter, pinch of salt and blend to make a smooth batter.Â\\xa0 The reason I am blending with the batter is, I donâ€™t have to add any additional water to the batter for grinding.Next for the spinach, add the spinach to the Mixer Grinder along with 1 cup of the dosa batter, pinch of salt and blend to make a smooth batter.Â\\xa0Keep both batters aside.The next step is to make spicy masala which will go into all three batters.Â\\xa0Heat oil in a pan, add the mustard seeds and allow it to crackle. Add the curry leaves, green chillies and chopped onion. Saute until the onion softens and turns lightly golden brown.Once done, turn off the heat.Divide this into 3 portions and add into the 3 batters (plain, carrot and spinach). Check the salt if required and add to taste.The final step is to cook the paniyarams.Add oil into each of the cavities. Spoon the batters into the cavity . Cover with a lid and steam until the top gets cooked.Once the top is steamed, open the lid and flip the paniyam and cook on the other side until golden and lightly crisp.Â\\xa0Transfer the paniyaram to a serving bow and serve it along with chutney for a hearty breakfast or even a snack.And this chutney is super simple to make - fresh grated coconut, along with a handful of almonds, a couple of green chillies, an inch piece ginger, salt and lemon. Blend using the Mixer Grinder and voila your chutney is ready in two minutes.And one small tip, if your coconut is cold or frozen, use warm water for grinding this chutney, you get the perfect texture.ServeÂ\\xa0Masala Paniyaram With Idli/Dosa Batter Recipe withÂ\\xa0Coconut ChutneyÂ\\xa0andÂ\\xa0Filter CoffeeÂ\\xa0as a tea time snack., 3 cups Idli Dosa Batter  2 cups Carrots (Gajjar) , grated  2 cups Spinach , finely chopped Salt , to taste Classic Paniyaram Masala 2 teaspoons Mustard seeds (Rai/ Kadugu)  4 Green Chillies , finely chopped  2 cups Pearl onions (Sambar Onions) , finely chopped  1/4 cup Coriander (Dhania) Leaves , finely chopped Oil , for shallow frying ,Idli Dosa Batter, Carrots, Spinach, Salt, Classic Paniyaram Masala, Mustard seeds Green Chillies, Pearl onions, Coriander Leaves, Oil, shallow frying]\",\n",

TheÂ\\xa0Jalebi is a traditional sweet dish that is made on every festival, special occasions and monsoons. And so much so even homes make this dish to celebrate the occasion. This homemade Jalebi recipe is actually very easy to prepare and tastes absolutely delicious. Festivals like Holi and Diwali are incomplete without the preparation of this class Indian dessert - Jalebi.,North Indian Recipes,Dessert,Vegetarian,540,To begin making the Jalebi Recipe, we will first begin the preparation by mixing the maida, corn flour, baking soda, ghee and turmeric powder in a medium bowl. Â\\xa0Combine all the dry ingredients well, until well combined.Add yogurt to the dry ingredients and blend them all together to make a thick batter by adding very little water. The consistency of the batter should be thick and not watery, similar to the butter cream batter. You should be able to make a shape when piped in a piping bag.When done, cover the jalebi batter and place it in a warm place for 24 hours or overnight, till it is fermented (the batter will rise on fermentation). Once the batter is fermented stir the batter in a cut and fold motion to combine it once again.Dont over stir you want the air pockets in the batter to remain. This will help in the jalebi being crisp and also in turn help it absorb the sugar syrup.To make the sugar syrup, boil the sugar with water and saffron powder in a small bowl on medium heat until the sugar dissolves. When the sugar becomes thick and stringy of one string consistency.Turn off the heat and keep aside.Now to make the jalebis, preheat the oil for deep frying. Once the oil is hot enough, you will know this, when you add a drop of batter in and it will come rising to the top almost immediately.Once you have filled the piping bag, pipe spirals of the batter onto the medium hot oil, until you get at least 3 concentric circles.Â\\xa0Fry the jalebi on medium heat until golden brown in colour and crisp. Once the jalebi is crisp and browned, drain the excess oil out and immediately dip the jalebi into the hot sugar syrup.Piping the jalebis into the medium hot oil takes a little experience, the more you pipe the more practice you will get and the better you get at it.Â\\xa0The Jalebis should rest in the sugar syrup for at least a minute, after which they can be drained out of the excess syrup and then served.Enjoy these crisp, sweet Homemade Jalebis as a wonderful dessert or a sweet option for your guests.Serve theÂ\\xa0Homemade Jalebi Recipe as a Indian Party DessertÂ\\xa0for the festival of Holi or Diwali.Note:Ensure the batter is thick and firm, or else they wonâ€™t retain the shape of the jalebis.Â\\xa0The oil for frying should be medium hot. If it is too hot, the jalebis will end up burnt.Also make sure you keep the heat on low when you pipe the jalebis into the oil, this will ensure you can see the circles you are piping and also the jalebis will rise up slowly., 1 cup All Purpose Flour (Maida)  2 tablespoon Corn flour  3/4 cup Curd (Dahi / Yogurt) , Sour  1/2 teaspoon Baking powder  2 tablespoon Ghee  1 teaspoon Turmeric powder (Haldi) , for colour  2 tablespoons Oil , plus more oil for deep frying Ingredients for the sugar syrup 1 cup Sugar  1 cup Water  1 Saffron strands ,Purpose Flour, Corn flour, Curd, Sour, powder, Ghee, Turmeric powder, colour, Oil, more oil, deep Ingredients, sugar syrup, Sugar, Water Saffron strands]',\n",

After years of experimenting, I have arrived at the perfect method for making this sweet and hope you enjoy making it as well.,Indian,Dessert,Vegetarian,70,To begin making the Balushahi (Badusha) recipe, we have to follow a two stage cooking process. First is to make the fried dough and second the sugar syrup.Â\\xa0To make the dough In a large bowl add in the flour, the salt and a 1/4 teaspoon of soda.Â\\xa0Stir to combine the dry ingredients . Next add in the ghee to the flour mixture.Â\\xa0Using your fingers combine the flour and ghee to make coarse crumbs . Its takes a good one minute to get this texture. Once you get the coarse crumbs texture, add in the yogurt. knead just enough until all the ingredients come together.Cover the dough with a wet muslin cloth and allow it to rest for about 30 minutesAfter 30 minutes of resting the dough we will divide the dough into equal portions of large lemon size, making a dent in the center with the thumb. Take care not to press too much while shaping them as this can cause cracks in them.Cover the dough portions with a wet cloth and allow them to rest for another 15 minutes.Next, preheat the oil for deep frying. Start adding a few balls at a time into the oil and fry them on medium heat. The medium heat helps the balushahi to cook evenly from the inside.Once you notice that the dough balls come floating up to the surface flip over and fry until the bottom half is darker golden brown. Remember it is important to fry them on medium heat and not high heat so it gets evenly cooked from the inside.Once both sides are browned well, drain and continue the same with the remaining dough portions and keep them aside.Now let's get the ingredients needed for the sugar syrup.Â\\xa0In a sauce pan add in 1/4 cup of water, 1 cup of sugar and a teaspoon of cardamom powder. Â\\xa0With heat on medium, stir the mixture well until the sugar dissolves and the mixture comes to a boil.Once the mixture comes to a boil, add in the cardamom powder, turn the heat to low and allow the mixture to simmer until you get a single thread consistency.You will know that it has reached the single thread when you touch the sugar syrup between your fingers, you will find it sticky. And when the syrup drips from the spoon it will look a longer drop.We will now dip each of the fried doughs one at a time in the sugar syrup until it gets coated all around and arrange then on a platter. Continue the same with the remaining fried dough.Garnish the Balushahi (Badusha) with pistachios and allow them to rest until the sugar hardens.

Adjust the consistency of the dal, by adding water.Now the final step is to add the smoked flavor and to prepare the seasoning.To smoke the dal heat charcoal until red hot over the gas burner (direct flame). Once the coal is red hot, place it in a heatproof bowl.Place this bowl on top of the cooked lentils. Drizzle a teaspoon of ghee over the hot coal. The coal will begin to smoke almost instantly. At this stage, cover the dal pan and allow the smoke to circulate inside. This process of smoking a dal,Â\\xa0is called Dhungar or Coal Smoking Technique.After about a minute, open the dal pan and you will see the smoke effect has withered. Transfer the Smoked Dhaba Dal to a serving bowl.For the seasoning; heat a teaspoon of ghee in a small pan; add the cumin seeds, the slivered garlic, and red chillies. Allow the cumin to crackle for a few seconds and turn off the heat.

The addition of Ghee makes these parathas crispy and delicious.,North Indian Recipes,North Indian Breakfast,Vegetarian,60,To begin making the Aloo Paratha Recipe, first we will make the paratha dough. In a large bowl add in 2 cups of whole wheat flour and some salt.Use your fingers and stir in the salt into the flour. Add water a little at a time and knead to make soft, pliable paratha dough. Knead paratha dough for a couple of minutes until the dough is smooth and elastic. Use the fold press and knead motion to make the dough smooth.Next add a teaspoon of oil to coat the paratha dough and knead little more. You want a paratha dough that will be soft smooth and not sticky. Divide the dough into 8 to 10 equal portions. Cover the dough and allow the it to rest until you get the filling ready.The next step is to make the filling for the aloo parathas.Mash the potatoes into a coarse lumpy texture with your fingers or a fork.Once mashed, add in the green chillies, onions, coriander leaves, salt to taste, cumin powder, coriander powder, dry mango powder, garam masala, turmeric powder and finally if you want it extra spicy, the red chilli powder. Using your fingers again, mix all the ingredients into the potatoes until well combined.Divide the aloo paratha filling into 8 to 10 equal portions. This process of dividing and keeping the portions of aloo paratha dough and filling ready, helps you gauge the number of parathas you can make and if you need more or less of the filling.The final step is to stuff the filling into the aloo paratha dough.Dust the paratha dough in dry wheat flour, flatten it with your finger and place it on a flat surface. Roll them out thin to approximately 3 inches in diameter circle.Take a portion of filling and place it in the center. Next gather the sides of the paratha dough and bring them together. Remove the little excess dough which pops out when you bring the edges together. Press the filled aloo paratha dough down.Dust the filled aloo paratha dough in some flour and roll it gently applying very little pressure. Roll it to desired thickness and proceed the similar way with the remaining portions of paratha dough and filling.Preheat a skillet on medium heat and place the filled aloo paratha. Allow it to cook on medium heat for about 30 to 45 seconds and flip over.Add this stage add a teaspoon of ghee or oil and spread it around. Flip again, so the oiled side can cook on the skillet. Spread a little more ghee and keep pressing the parathas while on the skillet to cook the paratha evenly from inside out.Do the flipping over process a couple of times until both sides get cooked, browned and crisp evenly. Make sure you cook on medium heat as it allows the aloo parathas to get a crisp on the outside.Once the aloo paratha is cooked transfer to a plate and serve hot.Serve theÂ\\xa0Aloo ParathaÂ\\xa0along withÂ\\xa0Aam Ka Achaar RecipeÂ\\xa0orÂ\\xa0Â\\xa0homemade curdÂ\\xa0orÂ\\xa0Masala ChaasÂ\\xa0for your Breakfast.,Ingredients for the Dough 2 cups Whole Wheat Flour  1 teaspoon Salt , as required Water , to knead the dough Ghee , for cooking Ingredients for the Filling 4 Potatoes (Aloo) , boiled and mashed  2 Onions , finely chopped  1 inch Ginger , finely chopped  2 Green Chillies , finely chopped  1/2 teaspoon Turmeric powder (Haldi) , optional  1 teaspoon Coriander Powder (Dhania)  1 teaspoon Cumin powder (Jeera)  1 teaspoon Red Chilli powder  1 teaspoon Garam masala powder  1 teaspoon Amchur (Dry Mango Powder)  1/4 cup Coriander (Dhania) Leaves , finely chopped ,Ingredients, Dough, Wheat Flour, Salt, Water, dough Ghee, Filling Potatoes, Onions, Ginger, Green Chillies, Turmeric powder, Coriander Powder, Cumin powder, Red Chilli powder, Garam masala powder, Amchur, Coriander Leaves]',\n",

The Baatis are made from whole wheat flour, sooji and ghee with the addition of ajwain that adds to the delicious flavor of the baati.,Rajasthani,Lunch,Vegetarian,100,To begin making the Dal Baati Churma Recipe, we will first making the bati.Combine all the ingredients for the Bati together, except the jaggery until well combined. Add water to combine it well and make a smooth and yet stiff dough. Leave the bati dough aside for 20 minutes so it rests and becomes fluffy with the baking powder that we added.Â\\xa0Once the baat dough is well rested, knead again for a few minutes.Â\\xa0Divide the dough in large lemon size portions (about 12 to 15 of them). Preheat the oven to 180 C and bake the bati in the oven for about 20 to 30 minutes until browned on both sides.Make sure to keep turning the baatis around, until it is browned from all sides. The batis will tend to crack from the top while it is baking and that's completely natural.Â\\xa0Once the batis are golden brown in color from all sides, remove them from the oven.For the churma, I usually make it from the same baked bati balls. Take 3 to 4 of them, crush them and combine them with jaggery in a mixer to make a coarse powder. And that's it, churma is ready. The salt from the batis does not overwhelm the taste and tastes perfectly fine.The next step is to make the dal for the dal bati.Â\\xa0To make the dal, add all the ingredients into the pressure cooker, except the ingredients for the tadkaAdd 2-1-/2 cups of water and pressure-cook the dal for two to three whistles. After two whistles, turn the heat to low and simmer for 10 minutes and turn off the heat.Once the pressure is released completely, open the cooker and your dal is ready. Check the salt and spices and adjust to suit your taste. Transfer the dal to a serving bowl.The next step is to make the tadka. Heat ghee in a small pan, add the cumin seeds and red chilies.

Pour the dal over the baked baatis and serve.

In this recipe we have used a ragi idli dosa batter to make the Masala Dosa.Â\\xa0Traditionally, idli boiled rice and urad dal, along with some jaggery is used to make the dosa.,Karnataka,South Indian Breakfast,Vegetarian,60,To begin making the Mysore Masala Dosa Recipe, we will first make the Ragi (Millet) Idli Dosa Batter.Add idli rice and ragi in a big bowl together, the level of water required is an inch above the rice in the bowl. Let it soak for about 6 hours.Soak the urad dal and fenugreek in water such that all of the dal is completely immersed in water. The level of water will be 2 inches above the dal in the bowl. Let it soak for about 6 hours.First grind the urad dal into a fine smooth batter. While grinding just enough water to make it into a very very smooth batter. The batter will look fluffy.Grind the rice and millet mixture into a smooth batter, adding just the required amount of water to grind into an almost smooth batter. Adding too much water will make the mixture too watery.Â\\xa0Combine the urad and rice batter, add salt to taste and set aside for at least 12 hours or overnight until the batter ferments. You will notice the batter would have risen in volume.Hence you should place the batter in a large container so it has enough room to increase in its volume.*Note on fermenting the Ragi Idli & Dosa BatterFermenting has to take place where the weather is warm. So ideally in summer, the batter ferments very well and doubles or triples its quantity.But in cold places, the batter has to be kept in an oven. If your oven has a light, then turn on the light for a few hours with the batter in the oven.Once the oven is warm, turn off the light and let the batter ferment. If your oven does not have a light, then preheat the oven to warm, turn off oven then keep the batter in the oven to ferment. This process can be mastered with experience.*To Make the Red ChutneySoak the dry red chilli in warm water for at least 20 minutes.Once done you can add all the ingredients - Onion, ginger, garlic, roasted gram dal, soaked dry red chillies and salt into a mixer and grind with little water to form a coarse paste.You can check for seasoning and adjust the salt or spice level if you want later on and set aside in a bowl.*To make the PalyaPressure cook the potatoes with 2 cups of water, sprinkle little salt and cook for atleast 4 whistle.Once done allow the pressure cooker to release naturally, and drain all the water and peel off the skin and mash the potatoes and set aside.Heat a flat skillet with oil, add mustard seeds and allow it to sizzle for few seconds. Sprinkle with hing and add curry leaves and allow it to sparkle for few seconds.Add sliced onions, ginger and garlic for few minutes and sautÃ© until the onions turn translucent.Add turmeric powder, salt and boiled potatoes and mix well until it is well combined. Check for salt and add coriander leaves at the end and stir. Add it into a bowl and keep it ready.*To make the Mysore Masala DosaThe next step is to assemble the dosa. Heat a dosa Tawa.

Which is one of the popular cuisine of India. The bread is rolled very thin, thus the name â€œRumaliâ€\\uf19d. As the word literally means Handkerchief in punjabi. It is an art to make this bread as you require certain technique and experience to make it so thin. But you can also roll it thin using a rolling pin. The bread is then traditionally cooked on an â€œUlte Tawa or Kadaiâ€\\uf19d which is nothing but a wok that is turned over.,Punjabi,Side Dish,Vegetarian,35,To begin making the Rumali Roti Recipe, mix all the ingredients together and knead it into a soft dough.Rest the dough for around 10 minutes. Then knead one last time and pinch out a small portion from the dough.Toss it on the flour and roll out into thin circles to approximately 6 inches in diameter. As you roll them out, you can keep tossing the dough in dry flour while rolling; this will prevent it from getting sticky when rolling them out.Roll it as thin as possible. Tip: It is a good idea to roll out a batch of dough so it gets easier to cook the entire batch. Although Gujarati ladies are very quick in rolling and cooking them simultaneously; this comes with practice of rolling and understanding the heat of your skillet.Heat a dosa tawa so that you can cook the big roti well. Place rolled dough on the hot skillet. In a few seconds you will notice that small air pockets start to form.

It is very similar to western ice cream but since kulfi is not whipped it results in a solid, dense, but rich, luscious creamy indian dessert.,North Indian Recipes,Dessert,Vegetarian,95,To begin making the Kesar Pista Kulfi, we will first have to condense the milk. For this heat milk in a heavy bottomed saucepan and bring the milk to a boil.Once the milk comes to a boil, turn the heat to low and simmer the milk with almost continuous stirring and reduce the milk to more than half its quantity.Â\\xa0It is important to note that during the initial stages of milk condensation frequent stirring is important, but as it begins to start condensing and reaches less than half the quantity it is absolutely important that you stir continuously.This is because condensed milk tends to get stuck to the bottom and sides of the pan and burn; leading to a very unpleasant taste. Burning of milk is also toxic so you want to be extra careful.Once it is reduced to about more than half of its quantity stir in the sugar until it dissolves completely. Finally stir in the cardamom powder, saffron and chopped pistachios into the Kulfi milk mixture.Turn off the heat and allow the kesar pista kulfi mixture to cool completely. Pour the kesar pista kulfi mixture in the moulds until 3/4th full, seal them airtight and freeze them in the refrigerator. The Kesar Pista Kulfi takes a good fifteen hours or more to freeze.

It has a fascinating origin, dating back to the ancient days when soldiers ate it as a staple war-time sustenance. During those days grains like wheat, jowar, bajra were a part of everyday meal. So soldiers would bury the prepared dough into smaller chunks and place it underground.

Cover the dough with a damp cloth and let it rest for half an hour.Meanwhile proceed to prepare the masala filling. For this, place a pan on the heat. Add some oil to it and allow it to get warm.

Also known as Obbattu or holige in Karnataka,Â\\xa0Â\\xa0puran polis in Maharashtra.,South Indian Recipes,Dessert,Vegetarian,150,To begin making the Thengai Poli Recipe first sieve the wheat flour and salt together in a large mixing bowl. AddÂ\\xa0 waterÂ\\xa0a little at a time to knead to make a soft dough. Adding enough water is critical, so the dough is soft and pliable. Add ghee and knead again. Knead the dough wellÂ\\xa0 to form a smooth dough. Once done make a smooth ball of the dough, cover the bowl and keep aside for 2 hours.In the meanwhile, prepare the sweet coconut filling. To do this, first heat a pan and add 1 teaspoon ghee. Next add the grated coconut, cardamom powder and palm jaggery to it.Stir well on a low flame for 5-8 mins till all the moisture is absorbed and the coconut mix comes together with the jaggery. Once the poli filling mixture has come together, turn off the heat and allow the mixture to cool.When it has cooled, divide it into equal sized portions and form balls the size of medium lemons.Now, take the dough thatâ€™s been resting and divide it into equal sized portions.Keeping a little flour for dusting handy on a plate; roll out the dough into 3 inch diameter circles. Place a portion of the filling (puran) mixture into the center of the circle. Bring edges of the circle towards the center and fold over to cover the entire filling; making sure the edges are all sealed well by pinching them together if there is any opening.Flatten the stuffed poli; dust the dough in a little flour and roll gently into a 5 to 6 inch diameter circle taking care not to put too much pressure as the filling can come out of the dough. The Thengai Poli should be thin and not thick. Once done, we will proceed to cook the poli.Preheat an iron skillet on medium high; place the rolled poliâ€™s onto the skillet to cook until golden brown on both sides. You can cook the poli's with ghee to give it a richer taste and flavor.Repeat the above process for all the remaining dough and puran portions and serve hot.You may store the Thengai Poli in an airtight container, in the refrigerator, once they have cooled. They will keep well for a week at least. However, if you are serving them on the same day, allow them to remain at room temperature.Thengai Poli if refrigerated is served by bringing it back to room temperature, slightly warming them in the microwave and served with a dollop of homemade ghee.Serve Thengai Poli for festivals such as Diwali, Navratri or even Janmashtami.Â\\xa0,For the dough 3 cup Whole Wheat Flour Salt , to taste  2 tablespoons Ghee Water , as needed, for kneading For the coconut filling 250 grams Fresh coconut , grated  160 grams Palm jaggery , powdered  1 teaspoon Cardamom Powder (Elaichi)  1 teaspoon Ghee ,dough, Wheat Flour Salt, Ghee Water, coconut, Fresh, Palm jaggery, Cardamom Powder, Ghee]\",\n",
